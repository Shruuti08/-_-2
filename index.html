      <h2><u>Hello</u></h2>
      <p>My Name is Shruti. Currently I'm studing in Third Year of E&TC Engineering from MMCOE College which is located in Pune.
        I'm interested in coding with languages like c++ and java. I also have knowledge about html and css.
        And this is why I wish to go forword with the same interest by availing different internships that will help me to learn more about the same.
        I have been successfully selected for an internship which is conducted by OASIS INFOBYTE on Web Development. And I will make sure that I'll be completing all the task
        given to me very honestly and sincerely.
